<h2>You're being connected!</h2>

<p>You'll get a call from us shortly with further instructions. <em>If you don't receive a call, you can call your City Councilmembers manually. Find them in the directory below.</em></p>

<p><strong>Here's a call script you can use to speak with the Councilmembers' staffs.</strong></p>
<div class="featurebox">
<p>My name is _____________ and I am an Oakland resident calling to thank you for your wisdom in deciding to follow state law and put the E. 12th St. parcel back out to bid.  Now it is critical that the City takes the next step to actively select a proposal that includes on-site low-income affordable housing on the E. 12th St. parcel.  I am asking that you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Work with the City Administrator and Real Estate Division to revise the notice of development to include a clear requirement for low-income affordable housing, post the notice on the Cityâ€™s website, and send the notice to ALL affordable housing developers in the region who have ever built, or would be interested in building, affordable housing in Oakland.  </li>
<li>Allow at least 90 days for proposals to be submitted after this new notice is sent out, and hold at least 2 community meetings to give input on the proposal to be selected.  </li>
</ul>
<p>I am now calling on you and the rest of the City Council to prove that this is an authentic and sincere effort by working aggressively to secure on-site low-income affordable housing -- the residents of Oakland will settle for nothing less. </p>
<p>
Thank you.</p>

<h2>Once you're done...</H2>
